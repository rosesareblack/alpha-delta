## Articles Created

### 1. Government Regulatory Evidence
**File**: article_4_government_regulatory.json
**Purpose**: Comprehensive overview of regulatory approval from Health Canada, FDA, and international agencies
**Content**: Medical necessity criteria, safety monitoring, clinical trial evidence, regulatory frameworks

### 2. Individual Case Study Articles
Created 7 individual case study articles from NY DFS external appeal decisions:

"""
    
    for i, case_data in enumerate(case_studies):
        summary_content += f"""
#### Case Study {i+1}: {case_data['case_number']}
**File**: {case_article_files[i].split('/')[-1]}
**Condition**: {case_data['condition_treated']}
**Summary**: {case_data['decision_summary']}
"""
    
    summary_content += f"""
### 3. Legal Precedents Overview
**File**: article_8_legal_precedents_overview.json  
**Purpose**: Comprehensive analysis of legal precedent patterns across all external appeals
**Content**: Appeal process overview, medical necessity criteria, regulatory oversight, documentation requirements

## Clinical Significance

This regulatory and legal content establishes the clinical foundation for ADHD treatment coverage by demonstrating:

1. **Government Regulatory Approval**: Official regulatory framework supporting ADHD medication efficacy and safety
2. **Legal Precedent**: Consistent external appeal decisions supporting medical necessity standards
3. **Documentation Standards**: Clear requirements for clinical documentation supporting coverage
4. **Regulatory Oversight**: Demonstration of regulatory framework protecting patient access to evidence-based treatments

## Integration with Existing Content

These articles complement the existing pharmacology content by providing:
- Regulatory framework supporting clinical protocols
- Legal precedent establishing coverage standards  
- Documentation requirements for medical necessity
- Patient and provider resources for coverage challenges

## Next Steps

1. Import all new articles into Strapi clearinghouse
2. Cross-reference with existing pharmacology articles
3. Create navigation structure linking regulatory and clinical content
4. Develop patient/provider resources based on legal precedent analysis
