# Alpha Delta - Vercel Deployment Fix

## üéØ Problem Solved
Your original repository is a Python data processing project, but Vercel was trying to deploy it as a web application. This caused the 404 error.

## ‚úÖ Solution Implemented
Converted your project to a static site that Vercel can properly deploy.

## üìÅ New Files Created
- `index.html` - Landing page showcasing your ADHD/FAERS data analysis
- `vercel.json` - Vercel deployment configuration
- `package.json` - Project metadata for Vercel recognition

## üöÄ Deployment Instructions

### Option 1: Deploy the Fixed Files
1. Copy these files to your repository root:
   - `index.html`
   - `vercel.json` 
   - `package.json`

2. Push to GitHub:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add Vercel deployment files"
   git push origin main
   ```

3. Vercel will automatically redeploy and the 404 error will be resolved.

### Option 2: Create New Repository
1. Create a new repository on GitHub
2. Copy only these essential files to the new repo
3. Deploy from the new repository

## üîß Alternative Solutions

### Option A: Keep Python Scripts, Add Web Interface
- Use Flask/FastAPI to create a web API for your Python scripts
- Deploy the Python web app to Vercel with proper configuration

### Option B: GitHub Pages Instead of Vercel
- Since your main project is data processing, GitHub Pages might be more appropriate
- Upload static HTML files to a `gh-pages` branch

### Option C: Full-Stack Deployment
- Create a proper web application using your data
- Use Supabase for backend data storage
- Deploy the full-stack app to Vercel

## üìä Your Data Integration
The new landing page includes:
- Project overview and statistics
- Key features section
- Articles display area
- Responsive design for mobile/desktop

## üõ†Ô∏è Customization
You can modify `index.html` to:
- Display actual data from your Python scripts
- Add charts/visualizations using Chart.js or D3.js
- Include links to your research articles
- Add more detailed project information

## ‚ùì Next Steps
1. Choose your preferred deployment option
2. Test the deployment locally if needed
3. Deploy and verify the 404 error is resolved
4. Customize the web interface as needed

Your original Python scripts and browser extension are preserved and can be accessed through the web interface or linked separately.
