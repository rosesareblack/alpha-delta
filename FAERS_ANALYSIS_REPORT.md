## Important Disclaimers

⚠️ **FAERS Data Limitations:**
- Reports represent suspected associations, not proven causation
- Reporting rates vary significantly between drugs based on usage patterns
- Higher report volumes often correlate with higher prescription volumes
- Data should not be used for direct drug-to-drug safety comparisons without considering utilization rates

## Clinical Context

This data provides valuable pharmacovigilance insights but must be interpreted alongside:
- Prescribing volume and patient exposure data
- Underlying patient population characteristics
- Indication-specific risk factors
- Post-marketing surveillance studies

## Monitoring Recommendations

1. **Continue FAERS monitoring** for trend analysis
2. **Integrate with prescription volume data** for normalized risk assessment
3. **Monitor emerging safety signals** through automated alerts
4. **Correlate with clinical literature** and regulatory updates
